An app created to inform users about the breast cancer and their risk of having this type of cancer based on results from a breast cancer risk assessment. After users take the assessment, they are provided with information on what they can do in their eating and exercise habits to reduce their risk. Includes preliminary functionality for sharing status of improvements with social networks. This app was developed using PHP and the SMART EMR in the SMART sandbox and entered into the Harvard University SMART Health App Challenge.
